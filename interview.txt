///.     How do you create a simple Express.js application?
       Express is a minimal and flexible web framework for Node.js. Express provides a set of features suitable for building web applications. In addition, Express provides HTTP utilities that allow you to develop APIs quickly and easily. Itâ€™s also suitable for creating API for mobile applications.
         const express = require('express')
            const app = express()
            const port = 3000
            
            app.get('/', (req, res) => {
              res.send('Hello World!')
            })
            
            app.listen(port, () => {
              console.log(`Example app listening on port ${port}`)
            })





///.      Implementation of all type of exports in backend application


   Default export
        // import
       import MyDefaultComponent from "./MyDefaultExport";
        // export
       const MyComponent = () => {}
      export default MyComponent;







///.       Create a middleware which will be applicable to all the routes

app.use(middleware)

        app.get('/',(req,res)=>{
            res.send(`i am home page `)
            res.end();
        })






///.        Implement CORS.

CORS stands for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing. It allows us to relax the security applied to an API. This is done by bypassing the Access-Control-Allow-Origin headers, which specify which origins can access the API.
